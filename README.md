## Experience

### Software Engineer at DBA Tecnologia
> June 2012 - Until now (3 years an 9 months)

DBA Tecnologia is a company focused in traffic analysis and paid parking systems. Here I work on a lot of challenging projects, which I enumerate a few below:

#### Company-wide:
I helped in growing company's infrastructure by making changes on hardware and software stack, deploying Git versioning system using Gitlab, creating the documenting habit by using a Wiki system. I also deployed virtualization technologies for fast-paced machine creation and destruction. 

#### Traffic System:
Developed a Node.js web-based system to organize data acquisition spots, schedule equipment installations and input collected data. Collected data input spawns asynchronous workers (written in C for performance reasons) which generate various reports, whose are then served through REST APIs to both desktop and web clients for human analysis and correction.

Developed a desktop application for callibrating, installing and collecting the data, which integrates with cloud APIs to send data on the fly, without need to return to office. For vehicle classification I also developed a desktop application which allow users to classify vehicles based on images, making the classification process faster and also less error-prone.

Both tools and culture introduced via the developed applications helped making the field process less error-prone, raising reports quality and lowering the delivery time, allowing the company to do more work, more efficiently.

#### Parking System:
Helped find market requirements and design the system architecture, which integrates lots of clients: Parkingmeter, parking fiscal equipments, citizen mobile application and website.

Designed and developed from the ground-up the whole embedded system running on the parkingmenter, from the ARM processor used, the operating system architecture (deployment, update) and tweaks (memory allocator, libc), device driver development, application and user interface developmet. I also contributed to mechanical design ideas and problem solving.

### Embedded Software Engineer at Ahgora Sistemas
> January 2012 - June 2012 (6 months)

Ahgora is a company focused in attendance and access control systems. I worked with bleeding edge technologies and an awesome team of experts. For them I worked mostly on embedded team, with some interesting projects.

#### RFID:
Rewrote the code of active, battery-powered RFID tags, making the code production-proof and focusing on lowering power usage, keeping protocol compatibility with previous product. Surprisingly, even not knowing the microcontroller and protocol I achieved this task in a week. We went to the bar with boss to celebrate the accomplishment! :)

Developed an Android passive RFID (ISO 18000-6c) reader software for asset management project, and started porting the software to a already existent embedded Linux platform.

#### Other projects:

Worked on prototypes for electronic labelling project, whose was used on supermarkets to update automatically the prices of shelves in a dedicated, low power embedded system which communicated using a own developed protocol over 2.4Ghz wireless.

### Operations Intern at Unioeste
> March 2011 - December 2011 (10 months)

Unioeste is the name of Universidade Estadual do Oeste do Paraná (or Paraná's West State University), where I studied Computer Science course for 4 years. There I was an intern in the IT division, helping other students with system login, troubleshoot wireless issues and fix laboratory computers. In the internship I participated in interesting tasks:

- Windows/Linux operating system deployment and domain migration
- PlayStation 3 clusterization for scientific processing
- Various proccess automatizations using batch scripts

### Full-stack web developer and graphical designer @ Freelancer
> January 2011 - December 2011 (12 months)

Designed the whole art of Harucon event, the anual Genshiken's anime club meeting, producing posters, flyers, tickets, tees and the website based on event's theme. The art was created using Adobe's Illustrator and Photoshop, designed taking care of the different media types, using CMYK process for print and RGB process for web.

The website frontend was designed in standards-compliant HTML5, CSS and JavaScript, including hand-made SVG animations. The backend was based in Drupal 7, which was pretty new at the time, and rendered a lot of contribution in porting Drupal 6 modules.

The deployment was planned in two parts, being the first phase a landing page with an animation of event's theme with a countdown timer for the event day, and the second, which replaced the first phase, the main website, deployed one month before the event, which included event's schedule, the description of each activity and a photo stream of previous events. There was an integrated Facebook comments box, which proved to be a nice channel for communicating with people interested in the event. In the end of the event the website was fed with photos taken by the staff, and stayed alive until the next event.

### Full-stack web developer @ mz2 webdesign studio (freelancer)
> October 2006 - July 2009

Implemented designs from Adobe Photoshop into standards-compliant HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Helped modelling MySQL databases and implemented backends mostly in PHP. Developed web components using Adobe Flash and ActionScript 3, integrated with page using JavaScript callbacks.
